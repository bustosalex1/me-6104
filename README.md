# ME 6104 Final Project: Interactive Curve and Surface Explorer

Authors: Alexander Bustos and Darren Kosen

## Initializing the Project

This project is built with SvelteKit and its intended package manager is yarn. To initialize the project and install dependencies, ensure yarn is installed on your system, then run

```bash
yarn
```

`npm` can also be used, but this option is untested. Dependencies can be installed here using:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

Once dependences have been installed, a development server can be started with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn run dev --open
```

Or equivalently with `npm`:

```bash
npm run dev --open
```

At this point, the application will open in a web browser.
